**2 player chess interface**

This chess board allows two players to play a games of chess. The board highlights which pieces the player can move and, when a piece is selected, which moves a piece can make. 

Note: This is a work in progress, the majority of this is complete but the logic for determining valid moves needs perfecting to ensure accuracy in all scenarios.
Additional features are planned such as displaying and logging the moves that are made in algebraic chess notation.
